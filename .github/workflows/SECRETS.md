## üìã Notes

- **`GH_PAT`** should have minimal required scopes:
  - `repo`
  - `workflow`
  - **Never use your personal PAT in shared environments**.
- **API keys (`VITE_API_KEY_*`)** are embedded at build time ‚Äî keep them secure and rotate periodically.
- Secrets like **Docker/Netlify tokens** must be limited to CI only and rotated quarterly.
- **Render deploy hooks** are secret URLs and must be treated as tokens ‚Äî never expose in logs or comments.
- **Basic auth for internal routes** (`PANEL_USER`, `PANEL_PASS`) is used to protect sensitive debug/admin views.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- **Never hardcode secrets** in workflows or source files.
- Use `workflow_call` + environments to scope secrets per job (`staging`, `production`).
- Rotate **all manually generated secrets** (PATs, tokens, DB creds) every 90 days.
- Use GitHub **environments with required reviewers** for high-risk deploys.
- Keep different secrets per environment (`PROD`, `STAG`) to prevent leakage/collision.
- Restrict Netlify/Docker tokens to least-privilege org/team/service accounts where possible.
