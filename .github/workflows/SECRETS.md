## üìã Notes

- **GH_PAT** should have minimal required scopes:
  - `repo`
  - `workflow`
- Tokens like **NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN**, **DOCKER_PASSWORD**, and **RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_PROD** must **never** be shared outside of trusted team members.
- **GITHUB_TOKEN** is auto-managed by GitHub but needs `permissions: write` in workflows to push branches/tags.
- Rotate Personal Access Tokens (like `GH_PAT`) every **90 days** as a security best practice.
- **Always** use GitHub Secrets, **never** hardcode tokens inside workflows.

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- Audit secrets regularly.
- Use least privilege principle: **only give secrets to workflows that need them**.
- If secrets are leaked or compromised, rotate them immediately.
- Use GitHub environments + required approvals for critical secrets (optional for advanced workflows).
